# HR_Analytics_Classification_Modeling_Using_Python
HR Analytics: Job Change of Data Scientists dataset from Kaggle is about Company X that is looking to hire data scientists who successfully pass their data science courses and trainings they offer. Company Xâ€™s HR department wanted to see which of these candidates really want to work for the company after completing the training and which of these candidates are taking advantage of their opportunity and in fact, they are not looking for employment with Company X. Using classification methods such as logistic regression, decision tree and random forest classification models, I predicted whether someone would be a job seeker or not. Then I further evaluated the performance of the models using several different evaluation metrics such as Confusion matrix - Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score, ROC Curve to find the best performing machine learning algorithms.
